# Unpapper app on Unsplash API | 1.0.1 (PhotoLibrary)

An application that searches for the necessary photos and images in the Unsplash library.


Technologies:
• API Unsplash (path: "/search/photos")

• Dependency manager: CocoaPods

• Embedded libraries: SDWebImage (CocoaPods)


Possibilities:
• Unsplash gallery search,

• Save selected images to iPhone,

• Ability to share selected images on social networks and instant messengers.


This is the first version of the application in which only the search part is implemented. Soon I will implement the first ViewController with popular photos.
